# Contributing to no_JIT

First off, thank you for considering contributing! Your help is essential for keeping this project great.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
- Please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under **Issues**.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, **open a new one**. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements
- Open a new issue with the title `[Feature Request] <Your Feature Name>`.
- Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature, why it's needed, and how it would work.

### Pull Requests
1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes (`forge test`).
4.  Make sure your code lints (`forge fmt`).
5.  Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").

### Solidity Styleguide
- Follow the official [Solidity Style Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.26/style-guide.html).

We look forward to your contributions!
